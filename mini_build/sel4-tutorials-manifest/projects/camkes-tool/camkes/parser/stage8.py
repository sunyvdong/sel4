        Recursive function for resolving setting references.  If a setting

        is a circular reference we error out.  If any setting doesn't have
        a setting to resolve to, but has a default attribute value we use that.
        If there is no default and no setting then we 'forget' the alias so that we
        can fall back to defaults that other attributes have.  An attribute that doesn't
        get a setting or a default will not generate a symbol in the generated template.
        Thus if the attribute requires a setting the code compiler should generate an error later.

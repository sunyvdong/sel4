'''
A Goanna wrapper to aid in suppressing false positives.

The Goanna static analysis tool is an excellent way of finding bugs in C code,
but it has no systematic way of suppressing false positives in the command line
tool. This wrapper script provides support for C code annotations to suppress
particular classes of warnings in order to achieve this. The C code annotations
are expected to be formulated as multiline-style comments containing
"goanna: suppress=" followed by a comma-separated list of warnings you want to
suppress for that line. For example, if goannacc emitted the following
warnings:

    foo.c:10: warning: Goanna [ARR-inv-index] Severity-High, ...
    foo.c:10: warning: Goanna [MEM-leak-alias] Severity-Medium, ...

and you had examined your source code and confirmed that these are false
positives, you could suppress them with the following comment on line 10:

    return a[x]; /* goanna: suppress=ARR-inv-index,MEM-leak-alias */

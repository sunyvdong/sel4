class ScopingContext(SimpleTraversalContext):
    '''
    A global context for managing recursive namespace scopes.

    The primary purpose of this class is for reference resolution. References
    may appear in the AST that consist of a symbol name. From their context and
    the CAmkES grammar, the type of the entity to which they refer can be
    inferred. References with attached type information are present in the
    output of the stage 3 parser, a.k.a. the lifted AST. The stage 4 parser
    uses one of these contexts to replace all such references by resolving them
    to the entities to which they refer.

    Usage of this class can be determined by looking at the stage 4 parser, but
    essentially, once you have constructed one of these, call `open` every time
    you enter a nested scope and `close` every time you leave one. Within a
    scope, `register` can be used to save an AST object by name. `lookup` is
    used to search for an entity by name, optionally limiting to type, in the
    immediate and all containing scopes. The first (deepest) matching entity or
    entities are returned. When you close a scope, all registered entities at
    that level are discarded.

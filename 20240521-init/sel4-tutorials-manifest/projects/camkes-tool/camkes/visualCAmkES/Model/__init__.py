# The Model python module

# This module deals with model side of the program. It communicates with the parser to collect an AST tree (AST_Model.py
# In the future ASTModel will create a unfrozen ast, allowing for editing.

# Common contains all the simple helper functions used throughout the visualCAmkES module.

# A lot of the model work is actually done in other camkes modules (such as parser, ast, runner, etc.)

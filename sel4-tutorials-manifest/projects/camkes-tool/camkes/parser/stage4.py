'''
Stage 4 parser. The following parser is designed to accept a stage 3 parser,
whose output it consumes. Note that this parser, and all parsers from here on
up consume and return the same type of AST representation. Parsers from this
stage and beyond are defined by their postcondition, which should hold on its
output in isolation and in conjunction with any subset of its previous parsers'
postconditions.

This directory contains files that conceptually relate to the CAmkES runtime
environment. For the most part you will need to pay this directory no mind.

builtin/ - ADL/IDL files that are analogous to the C standard library. You
    should arrange for this to be in the --import-path when runner the tools to
    let users reference files in here with "import <...>" syntax.

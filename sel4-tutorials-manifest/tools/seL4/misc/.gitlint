# So far, gitlint uses Python's `re.match()` (match from start) by default, but
# it will change to use the more generic `re.search()` (match anywhere) in the
# future. With 'regex-style-search' the behaviour can be controlled. Since we
# prefer `re.search()` anyway, the new behavior is enabled. For more details
# see also https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/configuration/#regex-style-search.
